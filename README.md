## 🛠 Technology Stack

### **Frontend**
- **HTML5** – Structure & semantic elements for accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3** – Styling, layouts, and animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Interactivity and client-side logic.
- **React.js** – Component-based UI, reusable elements, and efficient rendering.
- **Next.js** – Server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes for scalability.

**💡 Why?**  
React + Next.js ensures **fast rendering**, **SEO optimization**, and **developer productivity**. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the base for cross-browser and responsive UI.

---

### **Backend**
- **Firebase Hosting** – Fast, secure, and globally distributed hosting.
- **Firebase Firestore** – Real-time NoSQL database for storing user data, prompts, and generated assets.
- **Firebase Authentication** – (Optional future enhancement) for secure user logins.

**💡 Why?**  
Firebase is **serverless**, **scalable**, and easy to integrate—reducing backend management overhead.

---

### **AI Model**
- **Gemini API (Google AI)** – State-of-the-art image and content generation model.
- Capable of:
  - Text-to-image generation.
  - Prompt expansion and creative writing.
  - Converting design screenshots into functional code.

**💡 Why?**  
Gemini API delivers **high-quality AI outputs**, supports **multi-modal inputs**, and is **constantly improving** with Google's AI advancements.

---

### **Design Tools**
- **Figma** – UI/UX design prototyping.
- **Canva** – Simple graphics and layout creation for non-technical users.
- Used as **input sources** for Image-to-Code conversion.

## 🔗 How It Works
1. **User Interaction**  
   - The user inputs text, uploads images, or selects styles via the **React-based frontend**.
   
2. **AI Processing**  
   - The frontend sends the request to the **Gemini API**, which generates the required output (image, code, story, or prompt).

3. **Backend Management**  
   - **Firebase** stores generated results and serves static content.

4. **Output Delivery**  
   - The app displays generated results in real time and allows downloads or further editing.
